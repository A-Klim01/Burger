# Burger

Hello and Welcome to Burger App created by Alojzy Klim. In this assignment I created a burger logger with My SQL, node express, and handlebars. To Use the App, You can input a "burger" of choice. Once entered it will be on "waiting to be devoured list". Once devoured button is hit, the burger will change list to "has been devoured". Burger will be stored in the database.
